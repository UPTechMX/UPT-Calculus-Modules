## Description

This project contains all the calculation methods to evaluate the indicators included in the Urban Performance tool. 35 indicators related to the sustainable Development Goals were developed in order to assess the performance of several urban growth scenarios in the UP tool.

The Urban Planning Tool Urban Performance assesses the city's present and future performance by modeling investment projects or policies in a range of indicators related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including aspects such as poverty reduction, water management, energy, infrastructure, public transportation, climate action, etc. Urban Performance models multiple scenarios and spatial solutions to test the effectiveness of their contributions to sustainable development. Scenarios can serve.
